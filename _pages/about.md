Hi, I'm Sasha!
======
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Mila Institute and a Computational Social Scientist at the UN Global Pulse. Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Morgan Stanley (2018-2019) and Nuance Communications (2017-2018).

The research subjects I am working on are:
* The societal and environmental impacts of artificial intelligence (AI)
* Calculating the carbon impact of AI algorithms
* Ethical and explainable machine learning
* Best practices for data collection and sharing
* Deploying AI tools for humanitarian support
