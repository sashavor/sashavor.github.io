Sasha Luccioni is a leading researcher in ethical artificial intelligence. Over the last decade, her work has paved the way to a better understanding of the societal and environmental impacts of AI technologies. 

Sasha is a Research Scientist and Climate Lead at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/){:target="_blank"}, a Board Member of [Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](wimlworkshop.org/){:target="_blank"}, and a founding member of [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai/){:target="_blank"}, a global initiative that aims to catalyze impactful work and build a community at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

She has been called upon by organizations such as the OECD, the United Nations and the NeurIPS conference as an expert in developing norms and best practices for a more sustainable and ethical practice of AI. Her academic research has been published in conferences and journals  such as the IEEE, AAAI, the ACM, and Nature Machine Intelligence. Her work has also been extensively covered in the media by outlets such as the MIT Technology Review, WIRED, the Washington Post and Business Insider.
