Some of my current projects :
============================

* [**This Climate Does Not Exist**](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/visualizing-climate-change/) -- in which we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to visualize the potential future impacts of climate change. 
* [**CodeCarbon**](https://codecarbon.io/) -- I am contributing to creating a calculator to quantify the CO2 emissions produced during the training of AI algorithms.
* [**Climate Change AI**](https://www.climatechange.ai/) -- we are a group of volunteers catalyzing impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.
* [**Big Science**](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) -- BigScience is a one-year long research workshop on very large language models as used and studied in the field of Natural Language Processing and more generally Artifical Intelligence research. I am co-chairing the carbon footprint working group within the project.
